current blocks 

checkbox // appended checkbox image as link but wondering if there is a way to create an input with checkbox inside of the list item 
maybe createElement for the li and then .innerHTML for the input? unsure if that would make the checkbox able to work with another function since its not a variable - keep it simple for now, revisit

.remove is working on first click but unable to add list items unless page is refreshed - fixed

added event listener to li but its not working
