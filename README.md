### Goal: Build a Simple To-Do List

<h1> My simple Todo List </h1>

Create a functional TO-DO list that allows the user to type into the input box, and have their input appear in the list.
Have two buttons, one which clears the selected items only, and another which clears the whole list.

<strong>How It's Made:</strong>

<i>Tech used:</i> HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created this project by initially building the outline for where I wanted the crucial functions to be (AKA, the input boxes and buttons). I then wrote the JS which allows the inputs to be appear on the DOM which shows your "items to do". 
I made two separate buttons, one to clear the selected items when click, and the other to clear all items.
I finalized the functions of this project with making the Add button able to be inputted when you press the "Enter" key.
I finished up with pretty-ing up the page with some CSS and font changes.

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

With each project that I complete I always learn more about - not only JavaScript or whatever language I'll be programming in- but also how to do things more effeciently. Learning these fundamentals with experience has been much more effective.
With this project I learned that a single input function by default does work with the "Enter" key, however if you have a second input, then it messes up that function.
Additionally, I am improving when it comes to writing the functions, and parsing through the code to find mistakes that I make.
I found that it is best to get all the fundamentals down on my projects, and then go back at the very end to make it look nice with style.
