# Task Tracker

A simple to-do list Application. This app includes the ability for a user to add and/or delete a task and to mark a task complete.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

Task tracker was a great way to apply some fundamental JavaScript concepts like variables, functions and loops. 

## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future.

## Reflections:

This was a fun project to create and test out! It was definitely challengeing, but was really helpful with learning how to apply the JavaScript concepts we learned about during this time.
