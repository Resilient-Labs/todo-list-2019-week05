# âœ… Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Todo List

### Goal: Build a Simple Todo List

A project we were asked to build in order to help us understand the basics of JS even more! A fun and intriguing experience, I will make sure to come back to this and review the exacts steps I took to complete this.
We were expected to capture the essence of receiving an input and giving back an output! Definitely a little challenging for one of our bigger projects but nothing we couldn't handle with a little reading/ question asking!
Feel free to experiment/ change code around to your liking I hope you can sleep easier knowing that your chores are written out for later reference!!
