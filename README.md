### TO-DO LIST:
This project is a web-based "To Do List" application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and either clear all tasks or remove only the completed ones.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## What It Does
The "To Do List" is a interactive web-based application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Structurally, the webpage's foundation is laid out using HTML which starts with metadata in the head section. Google Fonts, the 'Roboto' font, is linked. The main body of the webpage is designed to have a header displaying the title, an input field to add tasks, a designated area to display tasks, and buttons for task manipulation.

The JavaScript functionality, in "todo.js", brings the To Do List to life. When the "+" button is clicked, the 'add' function is invoked, creating a new list item with an associated checkbox for the task. Tasks can be added and visually represented in the list below the input field. The "Clear All Tasks" button uses the 'clear' function to remove all tasks, while the "Completed Tasks" button triggers the 'complete' function to remove only the tasks that are marked as done. Additionally, there's a 'taskListUlItems' function that toggles a 'done' CSS class for list items, which can be used to visually separate completed tasks from non completed, by checkmark.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to set buttons to certain functions. i learned how to use the e function in event listener. I also played around with css buttons and shadowing.
