# âœ… Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Todo List

# To Do List

This is a To Do list application that allows users to add tasks that they need to complete to a list. The tasks will then show up on the list, and users call click on the check mark to strikethrough and mark the item as completed. Users are also able to clear out completed tasks and leave the incomplete ones still in the list.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

I don't think I have too many comments on the project - except to say I really like the CSS on this one. Simple but cute!
