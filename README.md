My Awesome Project
A to do list for all your needs. Write out what you need to get done! Then once you've finished, cross it off the list. Once you have finished all your tasks, you can clear the list.

<b>Tech Used</b>: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript

<b>What I Learned:</b> This task was challenging to say the least. The main thing that I took away from this was how I could link my CSS to my JavaScript to enable the crossing out once a task was done.
