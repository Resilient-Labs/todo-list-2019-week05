# âœ… Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: To Do List

This is a daily task tracker. You can add tasks, remove them if they are no longer applicable, check them when you are finish, clear completed tasks, and clear all tasks. The number of remaining tasks are tracked to help you organize your day!

### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project allows the user to add list items to their list. The user types in their task in an input and click a button named 'Add Tasks.' Then, their task will appear. This is achieved through adding an event listener on the button. Once the button is clicked, a new list element is created and will appear.


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use classes to influence the page's content and functionality. For example, there is a 'Clear Completed' button that will clear all tasks that the user has indicated are finished. In order to clear only the completed tasks, and not the ones still in progress, I added a class named 'completed', when the user clicks the complete icon to the specified item. Then, when the user clicks the 'Clear Completed' button, only tasks with the class of 'completed' will be removed.
