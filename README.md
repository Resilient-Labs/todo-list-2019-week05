# âœ… Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Todo List

### Goal: Build a Simple Todo List

### How to submit your code for review:

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>The HTML and CSS was simple enough; classic &lt;form&gt; inputs to allow user input, &lt;button&gt; for entering tasks, clearing tasks marked as 'completed,' and clearing tasks as a whole.</li>
  <li>The CSS was given a simple layout, my classic dashed lines with soft fonts.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript behavior was rebuilt, I had originally created a function that logged user input and placed it into a pre-existing &lt;li&gt;, but after getting an assist from an EIR, we decided to make the list grow as the user adds more inputs.</li>  
  <li>Beforehand, each task had a 'taskLog' (numbered 1-5) that would check if the previous task had a value in the innerText.</li>
  <li>With the new function that has adds innerHTML to an empty &lt;ul&gt; in the HTML, now, the user can have the list be as long as they would like.</li>
  <li>Using targetClass == 'LI,' it was able to toggle a class (.strikethrough) that made the text gain a strikethrough if it did not have one and vice versa.</li> 
  <li>Lastly, I implemented a function that would allow the &lt;li&gt; items with a strikethrough clear instead of the entire list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, I am proud of this project because of how <em>(seemingly)</em> air tight the function is.  I definitely had a large amount of help from an EIR who sat with me and gutted my functions and show me the usefulness of targetting a className.  I managed to add enough padding and margin so the list stays inside of the "box" even if a task is as large as a paragraph.  Now, I realize I sort of modeled the project after the way that the 'Reminders' app works on iPhone.  The fact the list is able to be endless rather than having an amount set at 5 really makes it for me. Go me (and Erica).</p>
<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: 5</li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: 5</li>
</ul>
