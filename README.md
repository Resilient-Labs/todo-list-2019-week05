#To-Do List

I created a front-end web application with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
The List features these actions:
* Add (Item) to List
* Click Item to Mark as Complete (Grayed and Lined-Through)
* Clear Completed
* Clear List
* Keep a running tally of To-Do's remaining

Key Takeaways
* sending information to the DOM (.innerHTML)
* receiving information from the DOM (.onClick, .value)
* .createElement and .createTextNode to create new elements and text
* .appendChild to define the parent-child relationships
* .querySelectorAll to target various groups
* .forEach executes a provided function once for each array element (MDN)
* this. set to the element the event fired from (via Event Handler)
* .parentNode.removeChild removes a child node from the DOM and returns the removed node (still in memory but not in DOM)(MDN).
* .toggle to toggle ON/OFF alternate class
