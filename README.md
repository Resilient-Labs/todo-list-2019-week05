# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
This project took HTML, CSS, and Javascript to get the desired result. I wanted my list to appear on the DOM 
as soon as I added my input and clicked the add button. The Javascript then took my input and created a new element 
with the list. The tricky part was getting the list items to be crossed out once a user clicked them. I was able to
get Javascript to and a new class from CSS with a text-decoration that crosses a line on the list items to be added
on an event when the user clicks their mouse. 
# Lessons Learned
This project taught me alot about interacting with HTML, CSS and Javascript files. It allowed me to see the interconnectivity 
of all three languages. It also taught me about how to set up events within the DOM, and how many flexible manipulating events within
javascript can be.
