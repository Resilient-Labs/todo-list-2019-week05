# My To do list
This project is a simple to do list where you are able to add items to the to do list. You will be able to cross out items in the to do list and remove them individually, or you can clear the entire list in a click of a button.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a wireframe for the to do list with 3 sections stacked on top of each other using HTML. Next I used CSS to give the sections a height, width, and a background color. I also used CSS to margin the buttons and the input to center them. Next I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the buttons and the list items.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that when using the innerHTML method, you can manually input an href into the input and it will return the URL to that href.
I learned a new method called appendChild and how it is used to store a child element into the parent element.
I learned the createElement method is used to create a new element within an existing element.
