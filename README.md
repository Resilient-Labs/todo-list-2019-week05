## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Brought to you by JavaScript, Todo List employs the use of three different functions to create, delete, and mark off todo list items. Each new item increments the todo count, only decrementing when a user marks a task for completetion and deletes the respective todo via the 'clear' button. Enjoy the nintendogs theme and audio player!

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

Chromium based browser do not allow audio players to play music automatically unless it is muted.
