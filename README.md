(![To Do List](siteSnip.jpg))

This is a basic to do list that can be used for many needs like tracking completed task or even a shopping list. The user can input their task or items and add more by pressing the Add Next Item button. when a task or item is completed the user can check it off using the given check boxes for each input. Once all input task are checked, and only when they are all checked off, you can press Done to receive a congratulatory message! The user can press Clear All Task to start all over with a new list! Enjoy!

Skills: HTML / JS
