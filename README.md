# Simple To-do List
This is a simple checklist. You can add your tasks, check them off, clear the completed tasks, and clear all tasks.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used event listeners to the '+' button to run a function to add list elements to the emply ul element in the html. I created a function to strikethrough the text of any completed items that were checked off. Lastly, the user can clear all completed tasks, and clear the entire list. This project was more focused on practicing JavaScript than going deep with CSS design like some of the other projects on my github.



## Lessons Learned:
I learned that you can create elements and append children using js. I had never done that before. I learned how to better use psuedocode to avoid mistake by first thinking through what I want to happen. I also practiced using the console and console.log to better identify when certain parts of my code are or are not running. Overall, I was able to detect my mistakes much faster than my last JS project.
