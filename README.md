This a simple to do list , where you can enter a task in, and it will list them for you. And once the task has been done, you click on the task itself and it will cross it out. Then you will have an option where you can click on the task complete button and it will only delete the task's that have been crossed out. then there is a side section where it will then show how many task's you have left.
