## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+

## Optimizations:

I'd like to redo the design and make it similar to Microsoft's To Do app. The notes would be on the top and the input box would be fixed at the bottom. When they don't fit on the screen, there is a scrollbar to view the other tasks.

## Lessons Learned:

* How to delete completed tasks all at once, using CSS classes
* Emptying an array, which helped with future assignments
* Using innerHTML to add list elements
* Using addEventListener() to create click events
