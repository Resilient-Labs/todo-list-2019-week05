## How it's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I wanted to create a to do list that leaves an impression and that also shows my personality.
With a simple gif and small simple interactions with the page, I created a very cute and memorable website.

## Optimization

There is always things to improve on a project and whats nice about this project is that I believe that it can go in many different directions. I could add little samll text whenever I completed a task, telling me I did a good job or as I complete the task, I can add a seperate list saying what task I completed.

## Lessons Learned

I learned that even something so simple could be something more interesting and fun with a little bit of creative thinking.
