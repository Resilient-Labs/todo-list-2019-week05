## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For this todo list project I utilized HTML for the layout, to create my form for the buttons and for the text boxes to take in each task. I then implemented vanilla JS to hook up the buttons and give each button its respective functionality. Once I had the buttons working I went ahead and created functions that could increase and decrease the counter, reset the counter each time the reset button is pressed, add items to the list when input into the text field by the user and finally added a cross out feature so that as each task was completed it would be crossed out. I also added a few extra functions for the cross out feature which would clear only tasks that had been completed and crossed out and simultaneously would decrease or increase the counter of to-do items left.



## Lessons Learned:

This project was a pivotal project for me because with this project I was able to implement not only HTML and CSS but also JS. By introducing JS into my tech stack I am now able to provide my clients with functionality for their websites. JS was definitely a learning curve but it has pushed me to grow as a software engineer. While getting a button to work for some is nothing for me it was a huge breakthrough in my tech journey.
