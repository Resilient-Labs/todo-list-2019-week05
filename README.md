# âœ…  Todo List Project

In this project, I create a to-do list where you can add multiple items to your list, click them to cross them out, and lso use the buttons to either clear the enitre list, or clear only the completed tasks. It also keeps count of how many tasks are left to complete.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I first created the HTML so I can have the elements to target, and the overall structure of the site. Using JavaScript functions, loops, and conditionals, I targeted all the buttons in order to create the list items, cler the completed items, and clear all the items. I also had to creat a function to cross off the completed items when you click them. The last step was to add the remaining task counter as well, which was added in the function the creates the list item first. From there, after the project was working Imoved on to CSS - where I was able to use a simple, yet vibrant design that works. 

## Lessons Learned:

Personally, this project was a bit more difficult to comprehend, as I am still getting stuck on the idea of loops. Going forward, I know this is something I need to keep practicing to have a better understanding. I also enjoyed designing this project the most. This is the type of design I am aiming for in my projects, simple and easy to use - yet sleek and clean. I hope to continue incorporating this style in my future work.
