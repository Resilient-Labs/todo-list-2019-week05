### Development:
** Languages Used: ** HTML & CSS, JavaScript
I learned the .createElement() method that allowd us to create the to-do list. The CSS was really simple but allowed for a clean design.

### Optimizations:
For a next step, I'd like to add an edit and remove button for each individual listed goal.
