# âœ… To-Do List Project ðŸ“‹

 To-Do List application that allows the user to dynamically add tasks, mark tasks as completed, clear completed tasks and remove all tasks.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


Optimizations:
I planned for use cases to improve the user experience such as preventing the submission of empty tasks and allowing the user to add new tasks using both the button and an "enter" keyup event.


Lessons Learned:
To create this project I used new skills to dynamically create elements and classes in the DOM. I took this learning a step further by implementing forEach() and event delegation for the first time. I look forward to utilizing these new tools in future projects.
