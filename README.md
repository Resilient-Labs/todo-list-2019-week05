# âœ… Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Todo List

### Goal: Build a Simple Todo List

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...

<h2>To Do List</h2>
This is my to do list project. Basically the user will input an item and the item will show up on a list.

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<strong>Tech used:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br>
This project was made with a very straight forward approach. I wanted the user to be able to be able to interact with the list and cross things out. While also deleting things that they've been able to complete. 

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
I learned about the preventDefault method which prevents the page from refreshing after the user puts info in the input and submitted it.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
Here is the link to my project with a picture included: <br>
