## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The HTML and CSS are very simple and could use some editing. The basis of this whole project lies in the JS. Most of my time was spent developing the JS and getting it to appropriately add to the list and removing the completed tasks utilizind DOM manipulation.

## Lessons Learned
I realize now that something that may appear simple at first can be more complicated at first. It is definitely best to tackle a project right away, especially the most difficult issues. Stack Overflow was the most resourceful of all my sources and just googling a question doesn't always give you the answer.
