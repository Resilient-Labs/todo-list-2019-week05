# âœ… Week05 Bootcamp2019 Project: Todo List

### Goal: Build a Simple Todo List

This is my simple To Do List project! Users can add individual list items via the green "+" button and also wipe the entire list via the red "-" button. In addition, if users want to cross out individual list items, they can click once to do that, and if they want to delete an individual list item, they can use the "trash" button.

### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

I made the basic styling and layout of the app via HTML and CSS. The main functionality of the app was made using Javascript.


### Optimizations:

I added additional styling to the fonts and images.


### Lessons Learned:

Learning about to how to create, style, and position HTML elements in Javascript was a huge game changer for me and I plan to utilize these new techniques more in my future projects.
