How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


This to-do list was really fun and became something that my mom uses.

Lessons Learned: 
Learned how to toggle a class, add a count that keeps track of the total and how many you completed. 


Bottom line:
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 5
I feel like I couldv'e seperated my functions better, and I would like to update it by allowing the enter key to input items as well.
