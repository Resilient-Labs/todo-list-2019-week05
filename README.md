This was a to-do-list that is fully functional. This was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adding a new item is done by typing it and clicking the "+ button. 

After this, the item is added to the to-do-list. One click on newly added item crosses it out with a line, two clicks on newly added item will make item 
completely dissappear
